# code-quiz

This app uses Javascript to create a code quiz for studying. Click on the "Start" button to intialize the five second countdown. Once the countdown hits zero, a new timer begins and the first question will appear. Each question will display on the card with four potential answers. Get the question correct and move on to the next question. Get the question wrong and time will be taken off the counter.

[Happy studying!](http://shookster.github.io/quiz-app/index.html)
